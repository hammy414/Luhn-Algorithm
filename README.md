# Luhn-Algorithm

> Additional information or tagline

A Python Luhn Algorithm I created off of the page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.

```shell
packagemanager install awesome-project
awesome-project start
awesome-project "Do something!"  # prints "Nah."
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

### Initial Configuration

Some projects require initial configuration (e.g. access tokens or keys, `npm i`).
This is the section where you would document those requirements.

## Developing

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hammy414/Luhn-Algorithm/import_string.py
cd awesome-project/
packagemanager install
```
